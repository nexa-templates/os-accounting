# Accounting template

This repository is a visual starter, not a ledger. Preserve the clear Merit-inspired navigation and original Nexa identity.

- Start with README.md. Customize index.html, styles.css, and app.js; Wrangler is a development dependency and there is no application backend yet. Publish the public preview to the Nexa Templates Worker, with the Preview label visible on mobile too; do not enable GitHub Pages.
- Keep sample figures and dates clearly identified. Do not claim tax compliance, reconciled balances, or successful bank synchronization from this preview.
- Work with the customer's accountant to define ledger entries, accounting periods, invoices, tax rules, and audit history. Use isolated data for migrations and calculation tests.
- Imported projects should use their own Cloudflare account, Worker name, resources, and secrets. Never commit financial records or credentials to this public upstream; retain Git history for future template merges.
- Run npm run build, check JavaScript syntax, and inspect desktop/mobile layouts and invoice filtering. Add meaningful accounting and authorization tests when real functionality is implemented.

This standalone version uses Cloudflare Access. Production must fail closed without its issuer, audience and application origin. Local sample tests run with PREVIEW_MODE=true; signed-token tests cover the production gate. Never enable preview mode for customer data or live email.
